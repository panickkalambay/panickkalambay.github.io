This study investigates sociodemographic, economic, and transportation-related factors influencing public support for or opposition to the adoption of autonomous taxis and ride-sharing vehicles (ATRSVs). A mixed-methods approach, including ranked cross-correlations (RCC), cluster correspondence analysis (CCA), and binary logistic regression (BLR), was employed to identify key factors associated with ATRSV support or reluctance. The RCC analysis revealed that favorable attitudes toward ATRSVs align with positive perceptions of the widespread use of autonomous passenger vehicles (APVs), comfort with road-sharing alongside them, and expectations of reduced travel stress. The CCA results show that women, older adults, individuals with disabilities, and those with lower education and income levels tend to be skeptical about ATRSVs. The BLR models further indicate that women, older adults, Asians, middle-income people, and those with less than a college degree show lower support for ATRSVs than men, younger individuals, Whites, and individuals with higher incomes, and those with a college degree. Travel stress was identified through pattern trees as a key factor contributing to reluctance or low support for ATRSVs among individuals from these demographics. Lastly, effective labeling has the potential to reinforce public support for ATRSVs. These findings could inform policies to mitigate concerns and foster ATRSV acceptance across various demographic groups.
